    <title>Transparency Object Rendering Order</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <p>This package provides the user with partial control over the rendering order
  transparent objects. This is useful for applications which contain a number
  of transparent objects which are not positioned so that Java3D can 
  automatically determine the rendering order based on the centroid of the 
  shapes bounds.</p>
  
  <p>To provide the control of rendering order this package introduces a
  TransparencyOrderedGroup. The semantics of this group are that all
  transparent Shape3D in the first child subgraph (or child index) are rendered
  before (therefore appearing behind) Shape3D's in the second child subgraph and
  so on for subsequent children. For Shape3D's in the same subgraph of a
  TransparencyOrderedGroup the rendering order is determined using the
  default technique of distance to eye from center of a shapes bounds.</p>
  
  <p>TransparencyOrderedGroups can be nested within subgraphs of other 
  TransparencyOrderedGroups.<p>
  
  <p>In order to use this package an instance of TransparencyOrderController must 
  be attached to the scene graph. For example :</p>
        <bold>locale.addBranchGraph(new TransparencyOrderController(view));</bold>
